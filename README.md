## Features

The Route Status Dashboard allows you track vehicle positions on a map, receive status updates relating to stops/orders, and monitor pre-defined alerts associated with each route.

The Route Status Dashboard:
* Uses ArcGIS.com services for mapping.
* Uses ArcGIS.com feature services for storing routes, stops, positions, and order status.
* Works with a routing and scheduling application such as Route Planner (https://github.com/Esri/route-planner-csharp). 

## Instructions

See "TA Dashboard Installation & Configuration.docx" for setup and configuration instructions.

Also see transportation_analytics.chm for detailed instructions for setting up Route Planner for creating routes, configuring the ArcGIS.com feature service, and this dashboard sample application. 

WorkforceManagement.zip includes files useful for creating/publishing the ArcGIS.com feature service.
